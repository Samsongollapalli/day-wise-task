is <b>Earth's highest mountain above sea level</b>, located in the <u>Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas</u>. The china–Nepal border runs across its summit point.<mark>Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in)</mark> was most recently established in 2020 by the <del>Chinese</del> and Nepali authorities.

<i>Mount Everest attracts many climbers</i>, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the <b>"standard route"</b>) and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, <strong>Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall </strong>.

he <small>first</small> recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, <i>the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side</i>. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached <mark>7,000 m (22,970 ft)</mark> on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking <b>the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft)</b>.
