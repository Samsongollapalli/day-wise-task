<p>The <b> Nallamalas </b> (also called the Nallamalla Range) are a section of the <u>Eastern Ghats</u> which forms the eastern boundary of <mark>Rayalaseema region of the state of Andhra Pradesh and Nagarkurnool district of the state of Telangana</mark>, in India. They run in a nearly <small>northâ€“south alignment</small>, parallel to the <strong>Coromandel Coast </strong> for close to <mark>430</mark> km between the rivers, <u>Krishna and Pennar</u>. Its northern boundaries are marked by the flat <em>Palnadu<e/em> basin while in the south <del>it</del> merges with the Tirupati hills. An extremely old system, the hills have extensively weathered and eroded over the years. The average elevation today is about 520 m which reaches 1100 m at <i>Bhairani Konda and 1048 m at Gundla Brahmeswara</i>.Both of these peaks are in a north westerly direction from the town of Cumbum. <mark>There are also many other peaks above 800m</mark>.
