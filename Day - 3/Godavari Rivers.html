Is <u>India's second longest river</u> after the Ganga river and drains the third largest basin in India, covering about 10% of India's total geographical area. Its source is in Trimbakeshwar, Nashik, Maharashtra.<mark>It flows east for 1,465 kilometres (910 mi)</mark>, draining the states of <u>Maharashtra (48.6%), Telangana (18.8%), Andhra Pradesh (4.5%), Chhattisgarh (10.9%) and Odisha (5.7%).</u>

The river ultimately empties into the Bay of Bengal through an extensive network of distributaries. Measuring up to <b>312,812 km2 (120,777 sq mi)</b>, it forms one of the <em>largest river</em> basins in the Indian subcontinent, with only the <strong>Ganga and Indus rivers having a larger drainage basin</strong>. In terms of length, catchment area and discharge, the Godavari is the largest in <u>peninsular India</u>, and had been dubbed as the Dakshina Ganga (Southern Ganges).

The river has been revered in <strong>Hindu scriptures</strong> for many millennia and continues to harbour and nourish a rich cultural heritage. In the past few decades, the river has been barricaded by several barrages and dams, keeping a head of water (depth) which lowers evaporation. <b>Its broad river delta houses 729 persons/km2 â€“ nearly twice the Indian average population density and has a substantial risk of flooding, which in lower parts would be exacerbated if the global sea level were to rise</b>.
